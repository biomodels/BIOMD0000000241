**Abstract:**   
We propose a parametric pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for caffeine
that quantifies the development of tolerance to the pressor effect of the drug
and characterizes the mean behavior and inter-individual variation of both
pharmacokinetics and pressor effect. Our study in a small group of subjects
indicates that acute tolerance develops to the pressor effect of caffeine and
that both the pressor effect and tolerance occur after some time delay
relative to changes in plasma caffeine concentration. The half-life of
equilibration of effect with plasma caffeine concentration is about 20
minutes. The half-life of development and regression of tolerance is estimated
to be about 1 hour, and the model suggests that tolerance, at its fullest,
causes more than a 90 percent reduction of initial (nontolerant) effect.
Whereas tolerance to the pressor effect of caffeine develops in habitual
coffee drinkers, the pressor response is regained after relatively brief
periods of abstinence. Because of the rapid development and regression of
tolerance, the pressor response to caffeine depends on how much caffeine is
consumed, the schedule of consumption, and the elimination half-life of
caffeine.

Caffeine intake in this version is modelled as cups of coffee drunk at regular
intervals (parameter _t_interval_ ). The amount of caffeine per cup is
determined by the parameter _cupsize_ . The body weight of the person drinking
is given by the parameter _bodyweight_ .  
The even _coffee cup_ occures delayed to the drinking of each cup, as the
availability of the caffeine in the digestive tract is assumed to be delayed
to the ingestion by the time _t_lag_ .
